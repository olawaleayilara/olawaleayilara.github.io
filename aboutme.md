I am a PhD student in the [Department of Community Health Sciences](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/health_sciences/medicine/units/chs/) at [University of Manitoba](http://umanitoba.ca/) under the supervision of [Lisa Lix](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~lixlm/) and [Mohammad Jafari Jozani](https://umanitoba.ca/statistics/people/jafari_jozani/). My research interests include Statistical Methods for Handling Missing Data in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), Longitudinal Data Analysis, Multi-level Modeling, and Data Visualization.  Previously, I have explored [Quantile Regression with Nominated Samples](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.7655) in my masters thesis. I'm also interested in Machine Learning techniques and Latent Mixture Modeling.
